# NordicUX

<h2>How I will build this page</h2>
<p>This is the real fist project I make where I'm taking off the training wheels and actually building with React from scratch. I will also implement features build with React such as a blog, a place to order a website and also learn how to use React Motion and also some GreenSock.</p>
<p>This webpage is beeing build as a traning project but also will work as my professional website to offer web services.</p>
<p>The goal here is to practise building with React and also making a fully functional website that serves as both a portfolio and as a Web-design agancy business</p>

This website is build with React , animations will be created with React Motion and also GreenSock.
