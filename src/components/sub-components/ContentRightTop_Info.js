         My path to becoming a programmer has not been easy, but that is what I love about this. To be able to keep going
          and eventually getting what you have been trying to work, actually work! I have been following my passion now for about a year and I love it. I hope that my enthusiasm will benefit you as well. Feel free to contact me.
